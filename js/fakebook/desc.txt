A front-end comment engine a la Facebook written in vanilla javascript and CSS3. As there is no back-end, the pre-filled comment and user
lists are seeded with data loaded from JSON files. Based on this dummy data, the system assumes you are logged in as user 5, "Daniel Craig." You
may post updates, and add comments on those updates. Comments are stored locally for as long as possible
until they could theoretically be uploaded to a server (in the case of having a spotty connection where making frequent HTTP requests 
is not possible). Note that the comments the user enters will persist even after closing the tab or the browser. Of course
using a different browser or restarting the computer will clear this information. To manually clear the data in the comment
list, using a javascript console in firefox or chrome, run Box.empty() and refresh the page.
