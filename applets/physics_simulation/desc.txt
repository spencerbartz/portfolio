Physics Simulation uses the projectile motion principles taught in undergraduate physics classes to draw a graph of a 
projectile under the influence of the earth's gravity. The user may input the angle of the initial velocity and optionally
enter a value for wind resistance. The area under the curve (integral) and arc length (how far the projectile traveled in
both the x and y directions) may also be calculated.
