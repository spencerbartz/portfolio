SimpleDraw 2.0 is a paint program a la MS Paint. SimpleDraw 1.0 is currently in the <a href="../applets/simpledraw/index.php">Applets</a>
section. With security restrictions introduced in Java 1.8 and the dominance of JavaScript and Flash for web applications, Applets have
become more trouble than they are worth. SimpleDraw 2.0 offers the stability of a Desktop application while still providing the 
"upload to hall of fame" functionality that was included in SimpleDraw 1.0. The simpledraw2.0.jar file is runnable and should launch on 
double click if your java configuration is set up to do so. If not, it can be run from the command line with <strong>java -jar simpledraw2.0.jar</strong>
