Stammbaum (German for "Family Tree") is a family archive database application made using PHP, MySQL, and Javascript. Users can create new family member entries, upload photos, and edit photo descriptions and basic information. The file uploader is based on <a href="http://digitarald.de/project/fancyupload/">Fancy Upload</a> which uses Flash to show the progress bar and allows the developer to hook into the animation events using Javascript. All text data is stored in a database, along with the path to each uploaded image file (stored on the server file system). Thumbnails of uploaded photos are generated server side using PHP. I am working on adding additional features, and eventually plan to add a dynamically generated visualization of a family tree. There are still some bugs and the UI certainly needs work, but the guts are all there and seem to be working!
